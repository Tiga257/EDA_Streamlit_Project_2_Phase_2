## Overview
This advanced telecommunications customer churn prediction platform leverages machine learning algorithms to identify customers at risk of discontinuing their services, enabling proactive retention strategies. The system provides actionable insights to help telecommunications companies reduce customer churn, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.

## Features
### Predictive Analytics
- **Real-time Churn Probability Scoring**: Assigns a churn probability score to each customer based on their behavior and demographic data.
- **Customer Behavior Pattern Analysis**: Identifies patterns in customer behavior that indicate a higher likelihood of churn.
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Pinpoints specific risk factors contributing to customer churn.
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Analyzes historical data to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- **Automated Alert Systems**: Sends alerts to relevant stakeholders when a customer's churn probability score exceeds a predefined threshold.

### Visualization Tools
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Provides an intuitive interface for exploring customer data and churn predictions.
- **Customer Segmentation Maps**: Visualizes customer segments based on demographic and behavioral characteristics.
- **Trend Analysis Graphs**: Displays historical trends in customer behavior and churn rates.
- **Feature Importance Plots**: Highlights the most influential features contributing to churn predictions.
- **ROC and PR Curves**: Evaluates model performance using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves.
